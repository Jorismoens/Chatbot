A playground for using the OpenAI Assistant API with various tools provided.
We provide the LLM with a function to retrieve random numbers and a function to get the temperature for a specific
location.
These tools are given to the LLM, and it can decide for itself when these are needed. A few example prompts to make use
of these tools are provided in prompts.py

Run main.py to start the script.
